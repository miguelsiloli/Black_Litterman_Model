    Adjusts portfolio weights based on technical signals for value, momentum, and sentiment.

    This function:
    1. Filters the value, momentum, and sentiment signals for the given `current_date`.
    2. Combines the signals into a single DataFrame to apply adjustments.
    3. Calculates an adjustment factor for each asset based on the sum of the signals.
    4. Adjusts the portfolio weights by applying a 30% adjustment for each signal score.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    regime_weights : dict
        The initial portfolio weights based on the current economic regime.

    current_date : pd.Timestamp
        The date for which to apply the technical signals.

    asset : pd.DataFrame
        The DataFrame containing the asset data (usually prices or returns) with assets as columns.

    value_signal : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the value signals for each asset, with dates as the index.

    momentum_signal : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the momentum signals for each asset, with dates as the index.

    sentiment_signal : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the sentiment signals for each asset, with dates as the index.

    Returns:
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary containing the adjusted portfolio weights for each asset after applying the technical signals.

    Steps:
    -----
    1. For each signal type (value, momentum, sentiment), the signal for `current_date` is extracted.
    2. These signals are combined into a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a different signal type.
    3. For each asset, the signals are summed, and based on the total signal score:
        - Positive signal: Increase the asset's weight by 30%.
        - Negative signal: Decrease the asset's weight by 30%.
        - Zero signal: No adjustment.
    4. The portfolio weights are adjusted accordingly and returned.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> regime_weights = {'Asset_A': 0.4, 'Asset_B': 0.6}
    >>> current_date = pd.Timestamp('2023-01-31')
    >>> value_signal = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Load or calculate value signals
    >>> momentum_signal = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Load or calculate momentum signals
    >>> sentiment_signal = pd.DataFrame(...)  # Load or calculate sentiment signals
    >>> adjusted_weights = apply_technical_signals(regime_weights, current_date, asset, value_signal, momentum_signal, sentiment_signal)
    >>> print(adjusted_weights)

    Notes:
    ------
    - The function assumes that each signal DataFrame has the same columns (representing assets) and index (representing dates).
    - It also assumes that the signals are numeric and are structured such that the value at a given date represents the signal strength for that asset.
    - Signals are weighted by 30%, meaning the final adjustment to portfolio weights is capped at Â±30%.

def initialize_portfolio(asset, current_date):

    Initialize a portfolio DataFrame with zeros based on the given asset data and current date.

    This function creates a portfolio DataFrame by filtering the asset data to include only the rows
    where the date is greater than the current date. The portfolio is then initialized with zero
    values for all assets, indicating no initial allocation.

    Parameters:
    - asset (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing asset data, with dates as the index and asset prices or returns as columns.
    - current_date (pd.Timestamp): A Timestamp object representing the current date for filtering the asset data.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame initialized with zeros, containing the same structure as the filtered asset data.

    ----------
    >>> # Example asset DataFrame

    allocation using the provided weights dictionary. The function assumes that the 'weights' dictionary

    and 'Federal Funds Target Rate - Up', which should be handled accordingly.

    Parameters:
    - portfolio (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame representing the portfolio with datetime index and asset columns.
    - weights (dict): A dictionary where keys are asset names and values are the corresponding weights
                      to be assigned for the next month.
